    <blockquote>"I live to provide hope to Northern Serenity. To fix the police system and stop letting criminals off with a slap on the wrist. And what better way to do that than diving into the core of the problem? I’m going to be in control of the police force here one day. And then you’ll see that I was right all along."<span>-Maxine Rubin, on her goals and beliefs</span></blockquote>

        <h3>The Ring of Deceit</h3>
        <p>Maxine's role in <em>The Ring of Deceit</em> is limited. She plays the role of a minor antagonist and never interacts with Madeline face-to-face until the final scene. She first appears when Juliette Sandover arrives at the NSPD HQ, wanting to use some fingerprint dust and ultraviolet lights. Maxine tells her father to not give it to Juliette on the basis that she never returned any of the other equiptment she borrowed. In the end, Caspar gives Juliette the equipment anyway, much to Maxine's discontent.</p>
        <p>Maxine once again appears later, when Juliette comes to the HQ for radio equipment. Once again, Maxine denies her request and engages in a sass-battle with Juliette until Caspar Rubin shows up and makes Maxine give Juliette what she needs. During this scene we learn about Maxine's feelings towards Madeline and her accomplishments as she belittles them and says the solving of the case was pure luck.</p>
        <p>When Maddie and Jules infiltrate Serenity Underground, Maxine arrives at Damien's condo and confronts Juliette, who wants her to use her authority to write up a fake warrant to get into the building across the street. Maxine refuses to do this because not only is it morally wrong, she would be risking expulsion from the NSPD were they to find out. Juliette resorts to blackmailing Maxine, at which point Maxine agrees but swears that she will never interact with Juliette ever again. The two walk across the street and enter, at which point they're ambushed by HiveMind henchmen. Thanks to Maxine's kevlar vest, the two escape unharmed and Juliette proposes that Maxine ally with her as she descends into Serenity Underground. Due to Juliette's blackmail, Maxine refuses and leaves her to "get in trouble on her own".</p>
        <p>After the explosion at the Hecht Warehouse is triggered by <a href=#>Maya Slawson</a>, Maxine is forced out of bed and arrives at the scene, citing Juliette and her team as possible suspects. Maxine confronts Madeline, who explains what she can. Maxine refuses to take up her explanation which prompts Maddie to take it to James Vernon, who ends up getting a share of the credit for Maddie's heroics</p>
