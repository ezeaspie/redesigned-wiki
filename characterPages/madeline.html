      <h2 class="textHeader">Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Madeline Lindsay Harbour</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>‘Maddie’</strong>, is a young private detective who operates in the city of <a href="#">Northern Serenity</a>. She is the main protagonist and titular character of <a href="#"><em>The Ring of Deceit</em></a>, <a href="#"><em>The Heroic Villainess</em></a>, <a href="#"><em>The Fate of Serenity</em></a>, and the <a href="#"><em>Harbour Adventures!</em></a> Series.</p>
      <p>Madeline is known by a majority of the city as being intelligent, charismatic, and capable and willing to solve cases that the <a href="#">Northern Serenity Police Department</a> can’t or won’t solve. As a result, she has grown to be a sort of community heroine for the poor and a villain to the rich and corrupting forces operating within the city.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='background'>
      <h2 class="textHeader">Background</h2>
      <p>Madeline was born in the <a href="#">Palisades</a> neighborhood in Northern Serenity to <a href="#">Clarissa</a> and <a href="#">Jacques Harbour</a> in 2002(citation needed). She spent the first year of her life with her parents, traveling with them and following her father around on his expeditions. Before her second birthday, Madeline's family moved into a home in the wealthy neighborhood of the <a href="#">Isle of Tranquility</a>. On the day of her second birthday, her father Jacques Harbour went missing and as a result Clarissa Harbour became overly protective of Madeline, shielding her daughter from the dangers of the world that Jacques was so fascinated with.</p>
      <p>Madeline grew up rich and without much problems. In elementary school she was popular and very well liked by students and teachers alike. It was in elementary school days where she met <a href="#">Juliette Sandover</a>. The two became inspereable after Madeline confronted <a href=#>Jimmy Jarvis</a> while in the middle of bullying Juliette. Despite the fact that Maddie ended up getting hurt and embarrassed by Jimmy, Juliette appreciated her display of "stupid bravery" and noted that her confrontation forced Clarissa to come up with a solution for Jimmy Jarvis. Juliette and Madeline grew close and learned different things from each other, Juliette most likely gave Maddie the motivation to experience thrills and adventure, while Maddie taught the then nervous-solitary Juliette to be more joyful and expressive. Around her 8th birthday, she met <a href="#">Julian Gaitan</a> in a local park and was intrigued by the way Jules saw and lived life. His lifestyle differed so much from her own lavish life, so she sought him in order to learn more. This is where her desire to help the victims in the West might have stemmed from.</p>
      <p>At the age of ten, Madeline began solving small mysteries for her neighborhood and school, impressing adults and petty criminals alike. She continued to grow her skills but never ventured past these ‘small-time’ cases out of fear that she would not be able to handle the increased pressure and out of fear of possible failure.</p>

    <section class='attributes'>
      <h2 class="textHeader">Attributes and Abilities</h2>
      <p>Madeline is both socially and technically intelligent, capable of thinking of solutions to any problem that comes her way. She is able to make connections between information and link seemingly unrelated clues to make a bigger picture. While she usually delegates research to Jules, Madeline herself is capable of reading and understanding complex texts and documents and in cases where she can’t, quickly finds a workaround or learns whatever skills she may need to understand a document or text. One prime example of this is when she was able to make a connection upon a few days of studying her father's documents.</p>
      <p>Another one of her strengths lies in learning. She is very quick to pick something up as evidenced when Jules taught her to sneak walk and she managed to do it without a second lesson or when Juliette taught her to lock pick and Madeline was able to pick a lock, albeit very slowly.</p>
      <p>Madeline’s charisma is also a major strength of hers. Using her charm, she is able to convince people of all backgrounds to help her or give her what she wants while befriending a majority of them in the process.</p>
      <p>Physically, Madeline isn’t the strongest, but in times of desperation she shows enough strength to kick open a air duct grate at the cost of severe pain in her leg. She is very nimble and has excellent balance, a result of her many years of ballet during her youth. In physical confrontations, Maddie rarely comes out on top in one on ones, but has shown that she is capable of taking on opponents and escaping or incapacitating them based on her environment or strategy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='appearance'>
      <h2 class="textHeader">Appearance</h2>
      <p>Madeline has light-medium colored skin and medium-blonde hair that she inherited from her mother. Her eyes are a light grey-blue and are a mix of her mother’s and father’s eye colors. Her body is thin and over time becomes more toned as she undergoes physical training after the events of <em>The Heroic Villainess</em>. She stands at 5 feet and 8 inches tall.</p>
      <p>In <em>The Ring of Deceit</em> Maddie often wears different colored variations of a shirt-blouse that covers her upper body and is ‘fashionably longer on the right side’ of the leg. She would often pair this top with grey pants and open toed shoes. Maddie always wears a gold necklace her mother gave her that consists of a cursive ‘H’ along with a <a href="#">gold bracelet on her forearm</a> that Juliette constructed for her as a gift. Maddie usually wears a clip on the left side of her hair to keep it in place. This clip is matched to the color of whatever outfit she is wearing.</p>
      <p>In <em>The Heroic Villainess</em>, Maddie dons a pale green trench coat, grey turtleneck, skirt, and leggings - wanting to appear more "mature" than she presented herself in the years before. She alternates and goes for a more casual look consisting of windbreakers, pants, and long gloves when out exploring regions like <a href=#>The Cove</a> or <a href="#">Fort Haven</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='personality'>
      <h2 class="textHeader">Personality</h2>
      <p>Madeline is generally loved by everyone she interacts with, or at the very least respected and appreciated. She is very kind and geniune with her intentions, rarely telling lies. Her dedication to honesty and trusting nature is usually and issue, especially when she's faced with someone trying to extract information from her. <a href="#">Alexandra Sage</a> saw and exploited this trait in order to gain insight into the <a href="#">Maeve Colbrun</a> investigation and the location of the <a href="#">Power Plant</a>. </p>
      <p>Maddie is also known for feeling guilt for getting her friends in dangerous situations on her watch. In <em>The Ring of Deceit, </em>Maddie offered Jules and Juliette an apology and told them that she wouldn't continue if it meant their safety after the two team members were injured by <a href="#">Alfonso Lima</a> in <a href="#">The Mines</a>. </p>
      <p>Madeline is desribed as 'fragile' by Jules because of her tendedncy to cry in intense situations and her tendency to not try things out of a fear of failure.</p>
      <p>In <em>The Heroic Villainess</em> and onward, Maddie starts to become more brave and capable of working on her own, although she still cares about her friend's safety and the wellbeing of others.</p>

      <h2 class="textHeader">History</h2>
      <div class='trod'>
        <h3>The Ring of Deceit</h3>
        <p>Madeline is initially shown solving a case involving some stolen answer sheets. She confronts Damien Schmidt, who she identified as a suspect ealier in the investigation. Through carefully chosen words and a bit of interrogation, Maddie is able to extract the information she needs to close the case for good.
        </p>
        <p>Later that day, Julian Gaitan tells her that she should consider solving cases in the corrupt Northen Serenity. After much neogtiation, Maddie agrees but realizes she needs to convince her overprotective mother to allow her to take on the &#39;big cases&#39;. Maddie ends up convinving Clarissa to reluctantly let her take on a case mentioned by a former friend, Ada Lima, who had a valuable ring stolen from her residence.
        </p>
        <p>Maddie goes to meet Ada Lima, who explains the historical and monetary value of the ring, which makes Maddie feel pressure to perform. Maddie learns about the Ruby Ring and how it has been passed down through generations amongst the Lima family. Ada also explains to Maddie that the ring was supposedly stolen while she was out of the house, leading Maddie to conclude that the theif must be someone who knows Ada&#39;s schedule well enough to plan a theft while no-one was in the home.
        </p>
        <p>Maddie gets Jules and Juliette to help her in the investigation while also hoping that her two best friends warm up to each other in the process.
        </p>
        <p>In her second visit to Ada Lima&#39;s household, she meets Robert Silva, Ada Lima&#39;s husband who admits that he is a bit relieved that Ada has the pressure of protecting the ring off her shoulders. This makes Maddie question Robert, who suggests that the housekeeper is the culprit. Maddie interviews the culprit while Jules and Juliette conduct field investigations and research. Juliette discovers a footprint mark in the room where the ring was found and Maddie scours the home and surrounding areas for more clues.
        </p>
        <p>Realizing that the footprint placement is unorthodox andstrange, Maddie tells Jules to begin looking into the history behind the home itself, believing that there might be something that they&#39;re missing. When Jules tells Maddie about the mines underneath the city, Maddie points out that there is a path that connects the Lima residence to an entrance located underneath Jamie&#39;s Jewlery Shop. Maddie begins to suggest that there must be some secret entrance to the home that would explain the footprints and the mysterious lack of evidence.
        </p>
        <p>Maddie meets Jamie but learns nothing of importance from him except that he is struggling financially and had to &quot;sell assets&quot; to stay afloat.
        </p>
        <p>Jules and Juliette find out that Jamie&#39;s cellar is the way to enter the mines after some research. Juliette suggests to break in, which Maddie is initially against but ultimatley agrees to. While the two are down in the mines, Maddie returns to the Palisades andfinds Alfonso Lima there, who arrived in Northern Serenity a few weeks after hearing about the disappearance of Ada&#39;s ring. He explains the history of the Lima sibilings and his desire to set things straight with his sister. He is initially unimpressed with Maddie, but quickly learns that she is capable of solving the crime and is on the right path.
        </p>
        <p>Alfonso suggests that they search the basement and Ada&#39;s room, looking for anything they might find suspicious. Alfonso sends Ada out of the house for a moment and makes Maddie believe he left along with her while he &quot;randomly finds&quot; the button that activates the basement door downstairs. Maddie enters the secret chamber, where Alfonso ambushes her and traps her inside once Ada returns, leading Ada to believe that Maddie uncovered something and fell in.
        </p>
        <p>Maddie remains unconcious in the chamber, presumblebly left to die, but she awakens later on to explore her surroundings and rescue her friends as they escape from Alfonso&#39;s attack in the mines. Once the three are united and in stable condtion after the attacks, Maddie starts to piece together the events. Maddie sets up a trap to get Alfonso in where Jules attacks Alfonso if he tries to attack Ada or Clarissa while they investigate the secret chamber. It works and they learn that Alfonso was the true culprit the whole time.
