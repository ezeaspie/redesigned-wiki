      <h2 class="textHeader">Attributes and Abilities</h2>
      <p>Selena prefers a tactical approach to her problems and usually does whatever it takes to tilt the situation in her favor. One example of this is when <a href='madeline.html'>Madeline Harbour</a> was being tracked down while she was trying to infiltrate Serenity Underground. Selena ordered her guards to stay vigilant around the vents, blocking Madeline's exits and forcing her to either give in or freeze to death in the vents. Most guards around her suggested that Selena give chase to Madeline since they knew for certain she was in the vents but Selena refused, stating that she didn't know what Madeline had on her or what Madeline was capable of.</p>
  <p>While she prefers to avoid physical confrontations, she manages to perform exceptionally well in combat. While she cannot inflict as much damage as someone stronger like Maya Slawson or Maxine Rubin, Selena makes up for this through quick movement and calculated attacks. She is nimble and swift and uses her agility and surroundings to her advantage. </p>
  <p>Due to her relatively small frame, Selena is capable of sneaking around almost anywhere. Her espionage ability is unrivaled and she is able to get whatever information she needs. This suggests that she might have skill at lockpicking, alarm tripping, or research, but these abilites are never outright mentioned in any of the books. </p>
  <p>Selena is also capable of using all sorts of equipment ranging from simple melee weapons to more complicated bow and arrows.</p>

    <section class='appearance'>
      <h2 class="textHeader">Appearance</h2>
      <p>Selena is very fit, giving her a slim yet strong body. Her face is a very light shade of tan and it is suggested that she is actually paler than she appears. This is likely due to the fact that a majority of her life was spent within the confines of Serenity Underground where there was no source of sunlight. Her eyes are a dazzling green and her black hair in <em>The Ring of Deciet </em>is of medium length, reaching down to the start of her shoulders. In <em>The Heroic Villainess</em> she cuts her hair to be chin length but wears a wig when taking on the alias of Mariana or Detective Sofia.</p>
<p>Selena was first shown wearing a purple cocktail gown, with her trademark mask and heels. In <em>The Heroic Villainess</em>, she dons multiple outfits as disguises. When she is in her actual form, she chooses to wear a catsuit under her leather pants and jacket to provide a sense of protection while not weighing her down. </p>
<p>Her mask is a light lavender in color and bears tracings that she herself designed when she was in Serenity Underground. The mask is made of a solid metal and is suggested to be bullet resistant. She is rarely seen without the mask and as of THV, she has only taken it off after Alfonso shattered it with a bullet.</p>
